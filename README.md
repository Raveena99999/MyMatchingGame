# MatchingGame

## Introduction:
Welcome to the Matching Game! This interactive game challenges players to match images with corresponding alphabets. Earn bananas by successfully pairing them up, but be careful, you only have three chances! Can you conquer the game and earn the coveted banana reward?

## Description and Functionality:
 Matching Game begins with a delightful introduction followed by clear instructions. Players are presented with two collections of cards: pink cards featuring images and blue cards displaying alphabets. The objective is to pair each image card with its corresponding alphabet card within three attempts. Successful matches earn players a virtual banana, while failed attempts encourage them to keep trying. Upon exhausting all three chances, a restart button becomes visible, allowing players to reset the game and try again. This engaging and intuitive game not only entertains but also challenges players' memory and cognitive skills.
